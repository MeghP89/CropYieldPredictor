# CropYieldPredictor

A data science project for predicting crop yields using machine learning techniques. All code is provided in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

This repository contains notebooks and resources to build, train, and evaluate models that predict crop yields based on agricultural data. The goal is to enable better decision-making for farmers and stakeholders by forecasting expected yields using historical and environmental data.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze agricultural datasets with visualizations and statistics.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implement and test various machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees, ensemble methods).
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Prediction**: Make yield predictions on new/unseen data.

## Repository Structure

- `.ipynb` files: Jupyter Notebooks with code and explanations.
- `data/`: Folder for input datasets (may be ignored in version control).
- `images/`: Visualizations and plots (optional).
- `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`: Dependencies (if present).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeghP89/CropYieldPredictor.git
   cd CropYieldPredictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   - Using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Or, with Anaconda:
     ```bash
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     conda activate cropyield
     ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the notebooks and follow the instructions within to run analyses or make predictions.

## Usage

- Open the notebooks starting with data and follow the step-by-step cells.
- Modify code or parameters as needed to experiment with different models or datasets.
- Results and visualizations will be generated within the notebooks.
